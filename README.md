# IoTCaP 

IoTCaP is a Platform based on the Vert.X toolkit and ICCF Framework foundations. 

IoTCaP collects capabilities from different sensors in the context of a smart building application. The building can be residential or a server room with specs to keep an eye on. The goal is to implement new capabilities through compositions. These capabilities are composed using the mPlane semantics while addressing ICCF contraints.
